# Running Par3 in the background

On Linux, macOS, and Windows, Par3 can run as a service for your user so you
do not need to keep a terminal open.

## Manage the service

Install the `par3` CLI first ([Install Par3](./install.md#command-line)), then
run these commands on the machine that will host Par3:

| Task                                  | Command                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Set up access from your other devices | `par3 up`                |
| See how your other devices reach it   | `par3 status`            |
| Install and start                     | `par3 service install`   |
| Inspect status and log location       | `par3 service status`    |
| Move to a newer release               | `par3 update`            |
| Restart                               | `par3 service restart`   |
| Stop and remove from startup          | `par3 service uninstall` |

Uninstalling the service leaves your projects, threads, and settings intact.
Running `par3 service install` again repairs a service that `par3 service status`
reports as broken.

`par3 update` downloads the newest release on your channel and switches `par3`
and the service to it. Restarting interrupts running agent turns, terminals,
and remote clients, so it asks first; answer no and the service keeps running
the old version until you run `par3 service restart`. Pass `--yes` from a
script. A server you started by hand is left running; stop and start it again
to pick up the new version. Wait for any remote update already in progress
before updating; to match a remote client's version, follow
[Updating Par3](./updating.md).

Pass an exact version (`par3 update 0.0.42`) to pin one, `--channel nightly` to
switch trains, or `--allow-downgrade` to move backwards. `preview` is a
maintainers' test train: its builds can be broken and are never offered as
updates, so the installer and `par3 update` ask for confirmation before
installing one.

`par3 uninstall` removes the background service, the `par3` launcher, and the
downloaded versions after showing you the list and asking once. Your projects,
threads, and settings under `~/.t3/userdata` are kept, along with `service.env`
under Par3 home. Pass `--yes` from a script.

## Local network access

A new service answers only on this machine. Other devices reach it through
Parity Connect, or directly once you choose the local network in `par3 up` (or run
`par3 up --lan`, which sets `T3CODE_LAN=true` in `service.env`). It then listens on
your local network and Tailscale addresses, so the desktop and mobile apps on
the same network connect directly instead of through Parity Connect. It still does
not answer on public addresses. Anyone on the same network can reach the port,
so a pairing code is all that keeps them out. The hosted web app at app.paritylabs.co.za
stays on Parity Connect, because browsers block plain HTTP from an HTTPS page.

A service installed before `T3CODE_LAN` existed keeps listening on the local
network. `par3 status` says so, and `par3 up --no-lan` turns it off. Any
`T3CODE_HOST` value replaces this setting.

## Configure the service environment

Put custom environment variables in `service.env` under the service's Par3 home
directory, normally `~/.t3/service.env`. This file survives service installation
and updates. For example:

```dotenv
T3CODE_PORT=3773
T3CODE_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

Use `KEY=VALUE` entries, quoting values that contain spaces or `#`. Values are
literal: shell commands and variable expansion are not evaluated. Entries
override the inherited service environment, except for `PATH`, `T3CODE_HOME`,
`T3_BOOT_SERVICE_UNIT`, and `T3_SERVICE_LAUNCHER_CONTEXT` (including case variants).

Run `par3 service restart` after changing the file. Changes apply when the service
starts again; switching the server version alone keeps the current values.
For a service installed before env-file support, run `par3 service install` once
with an up-to-date CLI.
A missing file is ignored; other read failures stop service startup.
If the file contains credentials, restrict access to that file with `chmod 600`
(for the default Par3 home, `chmod 600 ~/.t3/service.env`).

## Platform support

Linux needs systemd user services. Setup enables lingering so Par3 starts at
boot and keeps running after logout. If this needs administrator permission,
setup prints a recovery command before changing the service.

macOS starts the service when you log in and stops it when you log out. Keep the
Mac logged in and awake for unattended remote access. Installing over SSH while
nobody is logged in at the Mac's screen can fail at the final start step; the
service is still installed and will start at the next login.

Windows starts the service when you log in and stops it when you sign out. It
runs without a window as the `t3code-<domain>-<user name>` task in Task Scheduler, and Task
Scheduler starts it again within a minute if it exits. Lock the screen instead
of signing out, and keep the PC awake, for unattended remote access. Installing
over SSH while nobody is signed in at the PC can fail at the final start step;
the service is still installed and will start at the next sign-in.

`par3 up` installs the service when you set up Parity Connect, but the two are managed
separately. Signing out of Parity Connect does not stop or uninstall the service.

## Keep the server responsive when agents use all memory

On Linux, agents already run with lower priority than the server. When they
fill the machine's memory, though, the kernel may still slow down or stop the
server, because only an administrator can reserve memory for it. Run, as your
normal user:

```sh
par3 service protect
```

It shows the system settings it will change, asks before applying them, and
then asks for your sudo password. If the machine runs Tailscale or SSH, it
also offers to protect them, so you can still reach the machine. Memory
protection takes effect at once. The server's protection from the kernel's
out-of-memory killer takes effect after `par3 service restart`. `par3 service status` reports whether
the protection is in place, and `par3 service protect --undo` removes it.

## Troubleshooting

Start with `par3 service status` on the host. It prints the log path and, on Linux,
checks whether the installed service is running, enabled, and allowed to survive
logout.

If it stops when your SSH session closes, check for `linger-disabled`. An
administrator can enable lingering with:

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"
```

Over SSH, allow sudo to prompt:

```sh
ssh -t your-server 'sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"'
```

Then retry service setup as your normal user. Run only the `loginctl` command
with sudo; running Par3 as root creates a separate installation and Connect
identity. Without administrator access, run `par3 serve` in a terminal and keep
that session open.

| Status problem                          | Next step                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `linger-unavailable`                    | Run `loginctl show-user "$(id -un)" --property=Linger` and check that systemd-logind is available.                             |
| `user-manager-unavailable`              | Run `systemctl --user status` in a login session for the service user; check your distribution's systemd user-session support. |
| `service-disabled` or `service-stopped` | Read the log and, on Linux, `systemctl --user status t3code.service`, then use the repair command printed by Par3.             |
| `restart-pending`                       | A newer version is installed but the service still runs the previous one. Run `par3 service restart`.                          |

On macOS, check **System Settings → General → Login Items** if the service no
longer starts at login. If agent work cannot access Desktop, Documents, or
Downloads, it may need Full Disk Access for the `par3` executable listed in
`ProgramArguments` in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.t3tools.t3code.service.plist`.

[connection troubleshooting](./t3-connect-troubleshooting.md).

## Reclaim database space

Par3 removes internal history older than a day on its own while it runs;
your conversations are kept. Databases created before this shrank automatically
still hold the freed space on disk until a one-time offline repair returns it
and turns on automatic shrinking. Settings > Maintenance (web and desktop) or
Settings > Maintenance (mobile) suggests the repair when at least 1 GiB can be
reclaimed.

When the desktop app or the background service runs Par3 on that machine,
select **Reclaim** in Settings on web or desktop. Par3 checks for free disk
space, then stops, repairs the database, and starts again. It is offline while
the repair runs, and running agents stop. If the repair fails, Settings shows
why.

In other cases, such as a server you started by hand, run `par3 doctor` on the
machine that hosts the environment. It reports the database size and the
space it can reclaim, then asks which repairs to run;
pass `--fix` to run the recommended ones without a prompt (for scripts), or
`--dry-run` to only report. An installed background service for the same data
directory is stopped for the repair and started again afterwards, also when
the repair fails. Quit a server you started by hand, or the desktop app, first:
the repair refuses to touch a database that is in use. Use `--base-dir` for a
different data directory.

The repair's time grows with the size of the whole database, not only the
space it reclaims, and can exceed an hour on a large database or a slow disk;
`par3 doctor` shows each step as it runs. It rebuilds the database through a
temporary copy, so it needs free space of about twice the data still in use
(the database size minus the reclaimable space): once in the system temporary
directory (on Linux and macOS, `TMPDIR`, or `/var/tmp` when it is not set) and
once next to the database for its write-ahead log.

If you upgraded from a version before 0.1.0, its database (`state.sqlite`) is
still kept next to the current one so you can roll back. `par3 doctor` offers to
delete it, but never selects that repair for you and `--fix` skips it: once it
is gone, a version before 0.1.0 starts with no threads or settings.
